Examples for the Creative AI workshop. July 2019 @ [Muda Museum of Digital Art in Zurich](https://muda.co/)

## How to run these examples

You need to run a web server to see these examples.

A quick way of running a server locally is by installing [live-reload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-reload).

In order to run live-reload you need Node js

- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

From the terminal: 
- Run ```npm install live-server -g``` to install the live-server command globally

If you get an error related to permissions, you may want to run this command as an administrator by running
- ```sudo npm install live-server -g```

(it will ask for your password, just typed it in ieven if you don't see any letters showing up :) ) 

Finally, in the terminal go inside the folder containing all the examples: on macOS you can simply do this by just dragging the folder on your terminal icon.

Finally

- Run ```live-server```  to start the server
